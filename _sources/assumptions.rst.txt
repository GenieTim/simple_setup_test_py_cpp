Assumptions
===========

Quite a few assumptions were made in the making of this library, 
some of which have been adressed, others still remaining. 
They are all found in the documentation of the respective functions.

Here, we repeat them. If your system complies with these assumptions, 
you have no reason to be worried. 
On the other hand, if you encounter problems or get unexpected results,
you may want to check whether your system violates some assumptions.

1. Network strands and their atoms are at maximum bifunctional
2. There is only ever one atom type that is a cross-linker
